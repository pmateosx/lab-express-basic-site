            <p class="mx-4 mt-3">When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level. In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague. Van Gogh's work did not live up to expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result.</p>

            <h2 class="h2 mt-5 mx-4 border-bottom border-1">Portraits</h2>
            <p class="mx-4 mt-3">The portraits gave Van Gogh his best opportunity to earn. He believed they were "the only thing in painting that moves me deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite."He wrote to his sister that he wished to paint portraits that would endure, and that he would use colour to capture their emotions and character rather than aiming for photographic realism.</p>

            <h2 class="h2 mt-5 mx-4 border-bottom border-1">Self portraits</h2>
            <p class="mx-4 mt-3">Van Gogh created more than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889.They were usually completed in series, such as those painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death.Generally the portraits were studies, created during introspective periods when he was reluctant to mix with others, or when he lacked models, and so painted himself.</p>

            <h2 class="h2 mt-5 mx-4 border-bottom border-1">Flowers</h2>
            <p class="mx-4 mt-3">Van Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers, including roses, lilacs, irises, and sunflowers. Some reflect his interests in the language of colour, and also in Japanese ukiyo-e. There are two series of dying sunflowers. The first was painted in Paris in 1887 and shows flowers lying on the ground. The second set was completed a year later in Arles and is of bouquets in a vase positioned in early morning light. Both are built from thickly layered paintwork, which, according to the London National Gallery, evoke the "texture of the seed-heads".</p>
